# SCT_DS_02 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Task Description
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset to explore relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends.

## Dataset
Titanic dataset obtained from Kaggle.
The dataset includes passenger demographic and travel information.

## Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values in Age and Embarked columns
- Removed duplicates
- Created derived columns such as Age Group and Survival Status
- Cleaning and transformations performed using Power BI and DAX

## Exploratory Analysis
The dashboard analyzes:
- Survival rate by gender
- Survival rate by passenger class
- Passenger distribution by age group
- Survival trends across fare bands

## Tools Used
- Power BI
- DAX

## Key Insights
- Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive
- Higher fare bands showed better survival outcomes
- Age and class strongly influenced survival probability
